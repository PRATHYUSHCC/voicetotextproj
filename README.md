# Voice-to-Text AI Transcription App

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload audio files and receive transcribed text using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model (running locally). The transcribed text can be edited, saved to a PostgreSQL database, and exported as a PDF or plain text file. This project combines AI, modern web development, and backend database management into a powerful tool.
